%% Henon Stability Index %%
% This script contains the function to compute the Henon stability index
% associated with a dynamical solution of the problem

% Inputs: - state transition matrix STM, whose eigenvalues are to be analyzed

% Output: - the index s, containing information about close bifurcations around the solution associated with the STM

% New versions: use symplecticity to correct computational error

function [s, state] = henon_stability(STM)
    % Compute STM eigenspectrum 
    [~, eig, flag] = eigs(STM);
               
    % Henon stability indexes
    s(1) = (1/2)*(eig(1,1)+eig(6,6));    % Sum of the reciprocal pair
    s(2) = (1/2)*(eig(2,2)+eig(3,3));    % Sum of the neutrally stable pair
    s(3) = (1/2)*(eig(4,4)+eig(5,5));    % Sum of the remaining pair
    
    % Sanity check 
    if (flag == 1)
        state = false;      % Eigen-decomposition of the STM failed
    else
        state = true;       % Eigen-decomposition of the STM succeed
    end
