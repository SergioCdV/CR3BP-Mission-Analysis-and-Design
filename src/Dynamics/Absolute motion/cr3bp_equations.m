%% CR3BP Dynamics %%
% This function contains the 42-DOF translational model used within the rest of
% the CR3BP General Library scripts. It accounts for a infinitesimal mass
% moving in the normalized, non dimensional synodic frame define by the two primaries, which
% are assumed to be in the same plane and in circular orbits. It also
% contains the integration of the first variational equations of the flow.

% Inputs: - scalar mu, the reduced gravitational parameter of the system. 
%         - scalar direction (in binary format, 1 or -1), indicating the
%           time integration direction: 1 for forward integration, -1 for
%           backward integration.
%         - boolean flagVar, true for dyanmics and STM integration, 
%           false for only dynamical integration.
%         - scalar t, a reference epoch. 
%         - vector s, containing in an Nx1 array the phase space vector,
%           possibly augmented with the state transition matrix at time t.
%         - cell array varargin, to include GNC requirements on the motion
%           of the spacecraft

% Outputs: - vector dr, the differential vector field, which will include
%            the phase space trajectory and the STM integrated state when
%            flagVar is true.

% Methods: non-dimensional CR3BP dynamics in the synodic frame.
