%% Time flow %%
% This function contains a routine to obtain the flow of a initial condition from t0 to time 
% t1. It also outputs the STM at that point (stroboscopic map)

% Input: - scalar t0, an initial time from which integration is applied
%        - scalar tf, a final time to end integration
%        - scalar mu, reduced gravitational parameter of the system
%        - scalar direction, corcening the time direction of the
%          integration: 1 for forward integration, -1 for backward
%          integration
%        - vector x, with sizes 42x1, containing initial conditions for the
%          integration

% Outputs: - vector xf, phase space vector at time tf  (6x1)
%          - matrix STM, the state transition matrix of the system at time
%            tf

% New versions: integration with attitude dynamics
